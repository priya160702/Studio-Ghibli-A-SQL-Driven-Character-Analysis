# Studio-Ghibli-A-SQL-Driven-Character-Analysis

## Studio Ghibli Character Analysis with SQL 

Studio Ghibli films are renowned for their whimsical worlds, captivating storytelling, and unforgettable characters. From the gentle Totoro to the courageous Howl, these characters are more than animations—they embody emotions and narratives that resonate universally.

In this project, I applied SQL-based data analysis to explore the Studio Ghibli universe, uncovering character attributes, relationships, and unique traits hidden in the data.

## Objective

To leverage SQL queries to explore the characteristics, distributions, and relationships of Studio Ghibli characters, revealing patterns and insights that provide a deeper understanding of this animated universe.

## SQL Techniques Used

Data Retrieval & Aggregation: SELECT, AVG(), COUNT()

Filtering & Conditional Logic: CASE WHEN, WHERE

Joins & Subqueries: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, correlated subqueries

### Advanced SQL:

Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for intermediate results

Window Functions: RANK() for ranking characters by attributes

Array Operations: UNNEST(), string_to_array() for handling multi-valued fields

These tools allowed for structured exploration of character attributes, special powers, species, and other magical details.
